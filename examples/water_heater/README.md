# Water Tank Heater

A model of a water tank connected to a burner acting as a heater.

The water tank follows normal heating physics, reaching a maximum temperature of 100 degrees, and a minimum of 20 degrees.
There are two water tanks, one with twice the volume (and hence twice the heat capacity) of the other.
The burner oscillates between heating and cooling this water every 20 seconds.
