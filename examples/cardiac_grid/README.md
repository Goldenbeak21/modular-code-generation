# 5x5 Simple Cardiac Grid

A model of a 5x5 grid of (simple) cardiac cells.

This cardiac cell model is different to that of the `heart` example as it is a comparatively more simple "semi-linear" model.

This example uses many instantiations of objects so is a good candidate for run-time parametrisation.

**Root file:** `main.yaml`.
